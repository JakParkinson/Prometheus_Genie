I used absolite paths on the .sh slurm scripts that anyone on the cluster should be able to execute by runnign "sbatch ___.sh" except the conda environment conda activate myenv which has no easy way to use aboslute paths.

One way around this is to make a copy of my own environment using the yml file in this folder and the command:

conda env create -f /groups/icecube/shared_location/environment.yml -n your_env_name


If you use 'myenv' I think it should then work, but not sure as I can't really test this.
